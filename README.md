# Claudine Skills

Permissively-licensed reimplementations of Anthropic Claude skills.

## The Problem
Did you know that some official Anthropic Claude skills cannot be used outside of Anthropic products? Some Anthropic Claude skills come with restrictive licenses. Some may not be modified or used for commercial purposes without explicit permission. This creates vendor lock-in and limits the flexibility of developers who want to use these powerful capabilities in other environments.

## The Solution
`claudine-skills` provides high-quality, clean-room reimplementations of these skills. Our goal is to offer the same functionality as the original Anthropic skills but with **permissive licenses** that empower developers.

### Key Benefits
- **Permissive Licensing**: All tools in this repository are free for commercial use without legal risk.
- **Agent Agnostic**: Use these tools with any agent or CLI, including:
  - OpenCode
  - GitHub Copilot CLI
  - Custom LLM agents
  - And more!
- **No Restrictions**: You are free to modify, extend, and redistribute these tools according to their licenses.

## Available Skills

We are currently building out our library of tools.

- **XLSX Skill**: (In Development) A powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating Excel files. See [xlsx_skill_prd.txt](file:///Users/hacr/git-repo/claudine-tools/.taskmaster/docs/xlsx_skill_prd.txt) for more details.
